# Reinforcement-Learning-to-solve-JSSP

In this work I compare two RL-based approaches to solve the Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP). The first is a classic approach where the solution of JSSP is built from the ground up "A Reinforcement Learning Environment For Job-Shop Scheduling", where 
the second approach creates an initial solution, and aims to "repair" it, by performing local rewritings of the solution in order to improve it: "Learning to Perform Local Rewriting for Combinatorial Optimization".

In this work I examine the differences of the two approaches, and I propose how to apply the repair-oriented appoach to the classic JSSP problem, given that in the original paper, it was applied to a variant.
